I decided to make this open source and public for anyone wanting to revive or fix things. In the license attached, you should be able to make your own forks and modded versions as well just providing the credit and providing the source as well. 
Thank you for the support in playing the map, and I hope it's able to live on this way with the release of the game.

If you are needing the Building Pool and a few of the custom buildings that I had made, it can be downloaded here. It's about 340mb when extracted and contains a lot of the buildings modders had created years ago. Thanks!
